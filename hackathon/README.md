## Project Overview

## What is AutoMate?
AutoMate is a web-based chatbot that helps users find the right automotive parts quickly and intuitively. Users can interact with the assistant by describing their needs, uploading images, or providing vehicle details (like license plate). The assistant guides users through a conversational flow, suggests relevant parts, and can handle file/image uploads for better context.

## Features
- Conversational UI for automotive part search
- License plate and vehicle info integration
- Image/file upload support
- Smart suggestions for related parts
- Option to order or get more details on parts
- Modern, responsive design

## How We Addressed the Challenges
- **Challenge 1:** We explored ways to improve the search experience for automotive parts, including search by text and image.
- **Challenge 3 (Main Focus):** We built a smart assistant that guides users through the process of finding and ordering parts, using a scripted conversational flow and interactive UI.
